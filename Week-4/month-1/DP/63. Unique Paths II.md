**[Problem Description:](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/)**

Given a `m x n` grid called `obstacleGrid`, where each element is either `0` (representing an empty cell) or `1` (representing an obstacle), find the number of possible unique paths from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time, and it cannot step on obstacles.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**  
There are two unique paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:**  
There is only one unique path from the top-left to the bottom-right:
- Down -> Right

**Approach:**

- **Initial Check:**  
  If the start or end position is blocked by an obstacle (`1`), return `0` because there is no valid path.
  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
  - Use a 1D array `preRow` to store the number of unique paths to the bottom-right corner.
  - Traverse the grid from the bottom-right corner to the top-left.
  - For each cell:
    - If there is an obstacle, set the number of unique paths to `0`.
    - Otherwise, compute the number of unique paths by summing the paths from the right and from below.

**Solution:**

```java
public class UniquePathsWithObstacles {

    public static int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int rows = obstacleGrid.length;
        int cols = obstacleGrid[0].length;

        // If the starting or ending point has an obstacle, return 0
        if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1 || obstacleGrid[rows - 1][cols - 1] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[] preRow = new int[cols];
        preRow[cols - 1] = 1;

        for (int row = rows - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
            int[] curRow = new int[cols];

            for (int col = cols - 1; col >= 0; col--) {
                // If there's an obstacle at the current cell, no paths go through here
                if (obstacleGrid[row][col] == 1) {
                    curRow[col] = 0;
                } else if (col == cols - 1) {
                    curRow[col] = preRow[col]; // Only one path from the last column
                } else {
                    curRow[col] = curRow[col + 1] + preRow[col]; // Sum paths from right and down
                }
            }

            preRow = curRow;
        }

        return preRow[0];
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**

- The grid has obstacles blocking the start or end point, making it impossible to find a valid path.
- A grid with no obstacles where the robot can move freely.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The algorithm iterates over each cell in the grid once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since the solution uses an array to store the previous row's path counts.

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- Ensure that you handle obstacles correctly, especially when initializing the starting and ending positions.
- The usage of a 1D array for storing path counts significantly reduces the space complexity compared to a 2D DP table.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **2D Dynamic Programming Table:**  
  You could use a full 2D DP table to store path counts for each cell, but this increases the space complexity to `O(m * n)`. The current solution is more optimal by only using one row at a time.

```java
public static int uniquePathsWithObstacles2D(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
    int rows = obstacleGrid.length;
    int cols = obstacleGrid[0].length;

    if (obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1 || obstacleGrid[rows - 1][cols - 1] == 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    int[][] dp = new int[rows][cols];
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                dp[i][j] = 0;
            } else {
                if (i > 0) dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j];
                if (j > 0) dp[i][j] += dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[rows - 1][cols - 1];
}
```
