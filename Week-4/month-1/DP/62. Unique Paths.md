**[Problem Description:](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description/)** 

Given two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of rows and columns of a grid respectively, find the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner. The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `m = 3`, `n = 7`

**Output:** `28`

**Explanation:** There are a total of 28 unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `m = 3`, `n = 2`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** The unique paths are:
- Right -> Down -> Down
- Down -> Down -> Right
- Down -> Right -> Down

**Approach:**

- **Brute Force Approach:**
  - Recursively explore all possible paths by moving either right or down.
  - This approach leads to an exponential time complexity of `O(2^(m+n))` due to redundant calculations.

- **Memoization:**
  - To optimize the brute force approach, use a 2D array to store results of subproblems to avoid recalculations.
  - The idea is to store the number of unique paths from each cell to the bottom-right corner.
  
- **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
  - Use a bottom-up approach by starting from the last row and working upwards.
  - Initialize the last cell of each row to `1`, since there's only one way to reach the bottom-right corner from there.
  - For other cells, the number of paths is the sum of the paths from the cell to the right and the cell below.

**Solution:**

```java
package PracticeProblem.week_4.DP;

public class UniquePaths {

    // Dynamic Programming Approach
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {

        int[] preRow = new int[n];
        for (int r = m - 1; r >= 0; r--) {
            int[] newRow = new int[n];
            newRow[n - 1] = 1;
            for (int col = n - 2; col >= 0; col--) {
                newRow[col] = preRow[col] + newRow[col + 1];
            }
            preRow = newRow;
        }
        return preRow[0];
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**

- If either `m` or `n` is `1`, the number of unique paths should be `1` since the robot can only move in one direction.
- For larger values of `m` and `n`, ensure that the solution efficiently handles large grids without exceeding memory or time limits.

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, as the solution iterates through each cell in the grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since the solution only maintains a single row at a time in memory.

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- The brute force approach might be the first instinct, but it leads to inefficiencies. Leveraging memoization or dynamic programming significantly improves the solution by eliminating redundant calculations.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Memoization Approach:**
  - Store results of subproblems in a 2D array to avoid recalculating the number of unique paths from the same starting point.

```java
package PracticeProblem.week_4.DP;

public class UniquePaths {

    private int[][] memo;

    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        memo = new int[m][n];
        return uniquePathsHelper(0, 0, m, n);
    }

    private int uniquePathsHelper(int i, int j, int m, int n) {
        if (i == m - 1 && j == n - 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (i == m || j == n) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (memo[i][j] != 0) {
            return memo[i][j];
        }
        memo[i][j] = uniquePathsHelper(i + 1, j, m, n) + uniquePathsHelper(i, j + 1, m, n);
        return memo[i][j];
    }
}
```

This approach is less space-efficient than the DP approach, but it is easier to understand and implement.
