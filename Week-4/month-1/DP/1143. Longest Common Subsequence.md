**[Problem Description:](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/)**

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return `0`.

A subsequence is a sequence derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
```
text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
```
**Output:** 
```
3
```
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
```
text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
```
**Output:** 
```
3
```
**Explanation:** The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 
```
text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
```
**Output:** 
```
0
```
**Explanation:** There is no common subsequence between the two strings.

**Approach:**  

1. **Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up Approach):**
   - Create a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence between `text1[i:]` and `text2[j:]`.
   - Traverse both strings in reverse and fill the DP table:
     - If the characters at the current indices match (`t1[i] == t2[j]`), then `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i+1][j+1]`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])`.

2. **Memoization (Top-Down Approach - commented out in this case):**
   - Use a recursive approach to calculate the longest common subsequence and store the results in a memoization map to avoid redundant calculations.

**Solution:**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class LongestCommonSubsequence {

    HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {

        char[] t1 = text1.toCharArray(), t2 = text2.toCharArray();
        int[][] dp = new int[t1.length + 1][t2.length + 1];

        // Filling the DP array bottom-up
        for (int i = t1.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = t2.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (t1[i] == t2[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][0];  // The answer is in dp[0][0]
    }

    // Commented out brute force with memoization:
    // private int longestCommonSubsequenceHelper(char[] t1, char[] t2, int i, int j) {
    //     if (i == t1.length || j == t2.length) return 0;
    //     String key = i + "," + j;
    //     if (map.containsKey(key)) return map.get(key);

    //     int result;
    //     if (t1[i] == t2[j]) {
    //         result = longestCommonSubsequenceHelper(t1, t2, i + 1, j + 1) + 1;
    //     } else {
    //         result = Math.max(longestCommonSubsequenceHelper(t1, t2, i, j + 1), longestCommonSubsequenceHelper(t1, t2, i + 1, j));
    //     }
    //     map.put(key, result);
    //     return result;
    // }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**  
- Either string is empty, return `0`.
- The strings have no common subsequence, return `0`.
- Strings are identical, return the length of one of the strings.

**Complexity Analysis:**  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `text1` and `n` is the length of `text2`. The algorithm iterates through every combination of indices for the two strings.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the DP table. The memoization version also uses `O(m * n)` space for the memoization map.

**Mistakes and Learning:**  
- A common mistake is to miss initializing the base cases correctly, especially when filling the DP array.
- Memoization helps to avoid recomputation in the recursive solution but requires more space.
