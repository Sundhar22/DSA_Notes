### **[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-array-pairs-are-divisible-by-k/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-01)**:  
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to determine if it's possible to rearrange the array such that the sum of every pair of integers is divisible by `k`.

---

### **Example 1**:

- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `k = 5`
- **Output**: `true`
- **Explanation**: We can pair the numbers as follows:
  - `(1, 4)`, `(2, 3)`, `(5, 10)`, `(6, 9)`, `(7, 8)` — all pairs add up to numbers divisible by `5`.

---

### **Example 2**:

- **Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, `k = 7`
- **Output**: `true`
- **Explanation**: Pairing the numbers as `(1, 6)`, `(2, 5)`, `(3, 4)` results in sums divisible by `7`.

---

### **Key Idea**:
- We need to check if the array can be split into pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.
- For each element `x` in the array, the remainder when divided by `k` (`x % k`) is important. We need to ensure that for each remainder `r`, there’s a complement remainder `(k - r)` in the array.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

#### 1. **Calculate the Frequency of Remainders**:
   - **Key Idea**: For each number in the array, compute the remainder when divided by `k`. Store the frequency of each remainder in an array `freq[]`.
   - **Code**: 

   ```java
   int[] freq = new int[k];
   for (int x : arr) {
       freq[((x % k) + k) % k]++;
   }
   ```
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `x % k` gives the remainder of `x` when divided by `k`. 
     - The `((x % k) + k) % k` ensures the remainder is positive, even if `x` is negative.
   - **Example**: 
     - For `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `k = 5`, the remainders are `[1, 2, 3, 4, 0]`.
   - **Visual**: You could draw a table showing numbers and their remainders.

---

#### 2. **Check Special Cases**:
   - If any remainder is `0`, it means the number is already divisible by `k`. For these numbers, they can only form pairs among themselves, so we need an even count of numbers that are divisible by `k`.
   - **Code**:

   ```java
   if (freq[0] % 2 != 0) {
       return false;
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**: If the frequency of remainder `0` is odd, it’s impossible to form pairs, so return `false`.

---

#### 3. **Check Matching Remainders**:
   - **Key Idea**: For every remainder `i`, there must be an equal number of its complement remainders `(k - i)` to form valid pairs.
   - **Code**:

   ```java
   for (int i = 1; i <= k / 2; i++) {
       if (i != k - i && freq[i] != freq[k - i]) {
           return false;
       }
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**: For each remainder `i`, if the frequency of `i` is not equal to the frequency of `k - i`, then it’s impossible to form valid pairs, and we return `false`.

---

#### 4. **Handle Special Case for k Even**:
   - **Key Idea**: If `k` is even, the remainder `k / 2` needs special handling since it pairs with itself. We need an even number of elements with remainder `k / 2`.
   - **Code**:

   ```java
   if (k % 2 == 0 && freq[k / 2] % 2 != 0) {
       return false;
   }
   ```

   - **Explanation**: If the frequency of elements with remainder `k / 2` is odd, it’s impossible to form pairs, so return `false`.

---

#### 5. **Return True if All Checks Pass**:

   ```java
   return true;
   ```

   - If all conditions are met, the array can be rearranged into valid pairs.

---

### **Edge Cases**:
- **Array with only one element**: This will always return `false` since we need pairs.
- **Array with all elements divisible by `k`**: If the count of elements divisible by `k` is odd, return `false`.
- **k is 1**: Any array should return `true` since any sum is divisible by 1.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**:  

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Filling the `freq` array takes **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the input array.
  - The subsequent loop that checks conditions takes **O(k)**, where `k` is the divisor.
  - Total: **O(n + k)**.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - We use an extra array of size `k` to store frequencies.
  - Total: **O(k)**.

---

### **Mistakes and Learning**:
- **Mistake**: Forgetting to handle negative numbers when calculating remainders can lead to errors. The expression `((x % k) + k) % k` ensures that remainders are always non-negative.
- **Learning**: Handling special cases like `k/2` for even `k` and remainder `0` is crucial for making this solution work efficiently.

---

### **Summary of Key Steps**:
1. **Calculate remainder frequencies** for each element in the array.
2. **Handle special cases** for remainder `0` and `k/2`.
3. **Check if frequencies of remainders and their complements** match to form valid pairs.
