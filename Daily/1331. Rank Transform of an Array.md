### **[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/rank-transform-of-an-array/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-10-02)**:  
You are given an array of integers `arr`. The goal is to replace each element with its **rank**, where the rank is determined by how large the element is compared to others.  
- The **smallest element** should get the rank `1`, the next smallest `2`, and so on.
- **Equal elements** get the same rank.

---

### **Example 1**:

- **Input**: `[40, 10, 20, 30]`
- **Output**: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`

---

### **Example 2**:

- **Input**: `[100, 100, 100]`
- **Output**: `[1, 1, 1]`

---

### **Key Idea**:
- You are replacing each element in the array with its **rank**, based on how large or small it is compared to the other numbers.
- **Ranks** start at 1, and the bigger the number, the higher its rank. If two numbers are the same, they share the same rank.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**:

#### 1. **Understand the Task**:
   - You have an array of numbers, and your goal is to replace each number with a number that represents its **rank** in the array.
   - **Example**: For an array like `[40, 10, 20, 30]`, the largest number (40) gets the highest rank (4), and the smallest number (10) gets the lowest rank (1). 
   
#### 2. **Code Breakdown**:

```java
public int[] arrayRankTransform(int[] arr) {
```
- This is a method that takes an array of integers `arr` and returns an array of integers with their ranks.

---

```java
HashMap<Integer,Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
```
- **Key Idea**: A `HashMap` is used to store **each unique number and its rank**. For example, `map` might store something like `{10 -> 1, 20 -> 2, 30 -> 3, 40 -> 4}`.
- **Visual**: You could draw a simple table with two columns: one for the **number** and one for its **rank**.

---

```java
int[] sortArr = Arrays.stream(arr).distinct().sorted().toArray();
```
- **Key Idea**: You take the array `arr`, remove duplicates (`distinct()`), and sort the numbers (`sorted()`).
- **Example**: If `arr` is `[40, 10, 20, 30]`, after removing duplicates and sorting, `sortArr` becomes `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
- **Visual**: A doodle showing an arrow from the original array `[40, 10, 20, 30]` to the sorted array `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.

---

```java
for (int i = 0; i < sortArr.length; i++)
    map.put(sortArr[i],i+1);
```
- **Key Idea**: This loop assigns a **rank** to each number in the sorted array.
- Example: For `sortArr = [10, 20, 30, 40]`, the ranks will be assigned as:
  - `10 -> 1`
  - `20 -> 2`
  - `30 -> 3`
  - `40 -> 4`
- **Visual**: You could draw arrows from each number in `sortArr` to its rank in a `HashMap`.

---

```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    arr[i]=map.get(arr[i]);
}
```
- **Key Idea**: Now, you loop through the **original array** and replace each number with its rank, using the `HashMap`.
- **Example**: If `arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]`, after this loop, it becomes `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
- **Visual**: You could show the numbers being replaced one by one, like:
  - `40` → `4`
  - `10` → `1`
  - `20` → `2`
  - `30` → `3`

---

```java
return arr;
```
- Finally, you return the transformed array with the ranks.

---

### **Final Output**:
- **Example 1**: 
  - **Input**: `[40, 10, 20, 30]`
  - **Output**: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
  
- **Example 2**: 
  - **Input**: `[100, 100, 100]`
  - **Output**: `[1, 1, 1]` (since all elements are the same, they share the same rank).

---

### **Edge Cases**:
- **All elements are the same**: When all numbers in the array are the same, like `[100, 100, 100]`, they should all get the same rank.
- **Single element**: If the array has only one element, like `[5]`, it should simply return `[1]`.
- **Empty array**: If the array is empty (`[]`), return an empty array.

---

### **Complexity Analysis**:  

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time where `n` is the number of elements.
  - **HashMap operations** (inserting and looking up ranks) take `O(1)` for each element.
  - Overall: **O(n log n)** because the sorting dominates.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **HashMap** takes `O(n)` space, where `n` is the number of distinct elements in the array.
  - The sorted array `sortArr` also takes `O(n)` space.
  - Total: **O(n)**.

---

### **Mistakes and Learning**:

- **Common Mistake**: Forgetting to handle cases where the array has duplicate elements. Using `.distinct()` ensures that only unique numbers are considered when assigning ranks.
  
- **Learning**: Using a `HashMap` to map the numbers to their ranks helps avoid scanning the sorted array for each element, which would be inefficient.

---

### **Summary of Key Steps**:
1. **Sort the unique numbers**.
2. **Assign ranks** to each unique number.
3. **Replace** each number in the original array with its corresponding rank.
