[**Problem Description:**  ](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-swaps-to-make-the-string-balanced/description/)

Given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length `n`, consisting of exactly `n / 2` opening brackets `'['` and `n / 2` closing brackets `']'`, determine the minimum number of swaps required to make the string balanced. A string is balanced if it can be an empty string, or it can be written as `AB` where both `A` and `B` are balanced strings, or it can be written as `[C]` where `C` is a balanced string.


**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "][]["
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** You can make the string balanced by swapping index 0 with index 3.
The resulting string is "[[]]".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "]]][[["
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You can do the following to make the string balanced:
- Swap index 0 with index 4. s = "[]][][".
- Swap index 1 with index 5. s = "[[][]]".
The resulting string is "[[][]]".


**Approach:**  

- Initialize a counter `count` to track the balance between opening and closing brackets.
- Iterate through the characters of the string:
  - If the character is `'['`, increment the `count`.
  - If the character is `']'` and `count` is positive, decrement the `count`.
- The value of `(count + 1) / 2` will give the minimum number of swaps required to balance the string. This is because each unbalanced `']'` needs to be swapped with a `'['` to balance the string.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        char[] st = s.toCharArray();

        for (char c : st) {
            if (c == '[') {
                count++;
            } else {
                if (count > 0)
                    count--;
            }
        }
        return (count + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**  
- The string is already balanced, so the output should be `0`.
- The string is completely unbalanced (all opening brackets followed by all closing brackets).

**Complexity Analysis:**  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. The algorithm makes a single pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as the solution only uses a fixed amount of additional space.

**Mistakes and Learning:**  
- Initially, one might try to solve this using a more complex approach, but understanding the balance between brackets and leveraging the relationship between the count of unbalanced brackets simplifies the problem.

**Alternate Solutions:**  
- **Brute Force:** Try swapping pairs and checking for balance after each swap (Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`).

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int swaps = 0;
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int n = arr.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int imbalance = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] == '[') {
                    imbalance++;
                } else {
                    imbalance--;
                }

                // If we find an imbalance, perform a swap
                if (imbalance < 0) {
                    // Find the next '[' to swap with
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                        if (arr[k] == '[') {
                            // Swap arr[j] and arr[k]
                            char temp = arr[j];
                            arr[j] = arr[k];
                            arr[k] = temp;
                            swaps++;
                            imbalance = 1; // reset imbalance after the swap
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return swaps;
    }
}
```


This approach is less efficient but demonstrates the concept of balancing by brute force.

- **Stack-Based Approach:** Use a stack to track unbalanced brackets, then calculate the number of swaps needed (Time Complexity: `O(n)`, Space Complexity: `O(n)`).

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '[') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }

        int unbalanced = stack.size();
        return (unbalanced + 1) / 2;
    }
}
```

This stack-based approach is another way to solve the problem with a similar time complexity of `O(n)` but with a higher space complexity of `O(n)` due to the stack usage.
