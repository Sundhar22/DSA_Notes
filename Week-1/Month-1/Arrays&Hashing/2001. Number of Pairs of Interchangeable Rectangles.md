[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-pairs-of-interchangeable-rectangles/description/)

You are given a 2D array `rectangles` where each `rectangles[i]` is an array representing the width and height of a rectangle. Two rectangles are considered interchangeable if their aspect ratios are the same. 

Determine the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `rectangles = [[4,8],[3,6],[10,20],[15,30]]`

**Output:** `6`

**Explanation:** 
- The aspect ratios are 1/2, 1/2, 1/2, and 1/2 respectively.
- All pairs of rectangles are interchangeable. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `rectangles = [[4,5],[7,8],[5,7],[8,9]]`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:** 
- The aspect ratios are 4/5, 7/8, 5/7, and 8/9.
- Only the pair of rectangles with aspect ratio 5/7 is interchangeable.

**Approach 1:**

- Use a `HashMap` to keep track of the counts of each unique aspect ratio.
- For each rectangle, calculate its aspect ratio by dividing its width by its height and then normalize it by dividing both dimensions by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
- Count the number of pairs with the same aspect ratio using the `HashMap`.

**Solution 1:**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public long interchangeableRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
    HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    long count = 0;

    for (int[] rectangle : rectangles) {
        int gcd = gcd(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]);
        String ratio = (rectangle[0] / gcd) + "/" + (rectangle[1] / gcd);
        count += map.getOrDefault(ratio, 0);
        map.put(ratio, map.getOrDefault(ratio, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}

private int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b != 0) {
        int temp = b;
        b = a % b;
        a = temp;
    }
    return a;
}
```

**Approach 2:**

- Use a `HashMap` to keep track of the counts of each unique aspect ratio.
- For each rectangle, calculate its aspect ratio by dividing its width by its height as a `double`.
- Count the number of pairs with the same aspect ratio using the `HashMap`.

**Solution 2:**

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public long interchangeableRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
    HashMap<Double, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
    long count = 0;

    for (int[] rectangle : rectangles) {
        double ratio = (double) rectangle[0] / rectangle[1];
        count += map.getOrDefault(ratio, 0);
        map.put(ratio, map.getOrDefault(ratio, 0) + 1);
    }
    return count;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rectangles. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array of rectangles.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of unique aspect ratios stored in the `HashMap`.

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- Using floating-point arithmetic for aspect ratios can lead to precision issues. Normalizing ratios using GCD ensures accuracy and avoids potential pitfalls with floating-point representation.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Brute Force:** Compare each pair of rectangles directly and check if their aspect ratios are the same (Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`).
