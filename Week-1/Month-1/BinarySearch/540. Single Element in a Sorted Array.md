[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/description/)

You are given a sorted array consisting of integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element that appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in **O(log n)** time and **O(1)** space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**
- `nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]`

**Output:** `2`

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:**
- `nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]`

**Output:** `10`

---

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

---

### Approach:

We can leverage the fact that the array is sorted and use **binary search** to achieve the required **O(log n)** time complexity.

**Key Observations:**
1. Since every element except one appears exactly twice, the pairs of elements will split the array into two equal halves at some point.
2. If we find a pair where the left element of the pair is at an even index and the right element is at an odd index, then the single element must be in the right half of the array.
3. If the pair is reversed (left element at an odd index), then the single element is in the left half.

**Binary Search Process:**
- We maintain two pointers `s` (start) and `e` (end).
- At each iteration, we calculate `mid` and check whether `mid` is part of a valid pair.
- Depending on whether `mid` is part of a pair or not, we adjust the search range to look for the single element in the appropriate half of the array.
- The loop terminates when `s == e`, and at that point, `s` will point to the single element.

**Solution:**

```java
public static int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    int s = 0, e = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (s < e) {
        int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;

        // Check if mid is even or odd
        boolean even = mid % 2 == 0;

        if (even) {
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                // If mid is even and it's part of a valid pair, move start to mid + 2
                s = mid + 2;
            } else {
                // If it's not a valid pair, search the left side (mid could be the single element)
                e = mid;
            }
        } else {
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid - 1]) {
                // If mid is odd and it's part of a valid pair, move start to mid + 1
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // If it's not a valid pair, search the left side
                e = mid;
            }
        }
    }

    // At the end of the loop, s == e and it points to the single element
    return nums[s];
}
```

### Complexity Analysis:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)` because we're dividing the search space in half during each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we only use a few variables for the binary search process.
