[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Note:** You may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`

**Output:** `49`

**Explanation:** 
- The vertical lines are represented by the array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. 
- The max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `height = [1,1]`

**Output:** `1`

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

**Approach:**

- Use a two-pointer technique to find the maximum water that can be contained:
  1. Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start (0) and `right` at the end (`n-1`) of the array.
  2. Calculate the area formed between the two lines pointed by `left` and `right`.
  3. Move the pointer that points to the shorter line inward, as moving the longer line won't increase the area.
  4. Repeat until the two pointers meet.
  5. The maximum area calculated during this process is the answer.

**Solution:**

```java
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = height.length - 1;
    int maxArea = 0;
    
    while (left < right) {
        int cal = (right - left) * Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
        if (cal > maxArea) maxArea = cal;

        if (height[right] > height[left]) {
            left++;
        } else {
            right--;
        }
    }
    return maxArea;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `height`. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array with the two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as the solution only uses a fixed amount of additional space.

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- A common mistake is to use a brute-force approach by calculating the area for every possible pair of lines, which results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The two-pointer approach optimizes this by reducing the time complexity to `O(n)`.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Brute Force:** Iterate over all pairs of lines and calculate the area for each pair, keeping track of the maximum area found (Time Complexity: `O(n^2)`).
