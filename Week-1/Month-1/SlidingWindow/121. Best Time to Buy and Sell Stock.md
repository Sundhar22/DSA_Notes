[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** 
- Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6).
- The profit = `6 - 1 = 5`.
- Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`

**Output:** `0`

**Explanation:** 
- In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = `0`.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 10^4`

---

**Approach:**

- The idea is to traverse the array once, keeping track of the minimum price encountered so far (as this would be the best day to buy).
- For each day, calculate the potential profit by subtracting the current minimum price from the price on the current day.
- Keep track of the maximum profit found so far.
- If no profit is possible (i.e., prices are in descending order), the result will be `0`.

**Solution:**

```java
public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
    int low = 0;  // Tracks the lowest price so far
    int profit = 0;  // Tracks the maximum profit
    
    for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
        if (prices[low] > prices[i]) {  // Update lowest price if current price is lower
            low = i;
        }
        
        // Calculate profit if current price is greater than the lowest price
        if (i > low && profit < prices[i] - prices[low]) {
            profit = prices[i] - prices[low];
        }
    }
    return profit;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `prices` array. The algorithm only makes a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as the solution uses a constant amount of additional space.

---

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- A common mistake is to attempt a brute force solution by checking every possible pair of buy and sell days, which results in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`. The current solution uses a more efficient linear approach.
  
---

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Brute Force Approach:** Check every pair of buy and sell days, calculate the profit, and keep track of the maximum profit. However, this would result in `O(n^2)` time complexity and is inefficient for large input sizes.
