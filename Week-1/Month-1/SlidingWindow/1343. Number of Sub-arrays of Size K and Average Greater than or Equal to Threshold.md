[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sub-arrays-of-size-k-and-average-greater-than-or-equal-to-threshold/description/)

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of sub-arrays of size `k` whose average is greater than or equal to the `threshold`.

---

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
- `arr = [2,2,2,2,5,5,5,8]`
- `k = 3`
- `threshold = 4`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** 
- The sub-arrays `[2,5,5]`, `[5,5,5]`, and `[5,5,8]` have averages 4, 5, and 6 respectively. 
- All other sub-arrays of size 3 have averages less than 4 (the threshold).

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
- `arr = [11,13,17,23,29,31,7,5,2,3]`
- `k = 3`
- `threshold = 5`

**Output:** `6`

**Explanation:** 
- The first 6 sub-arrays of size 3 have averages greater than 5. Note that averages are not integers.

---

**Approach:**

1. Use a sliding window approach to compute the sum of the first sub-array of size `k`.
2. Check if the average of the current window (`sum/k`) is greater than or equal to the `threshold`. If yes, increment the result count.
3. For each subsequent window, slide the window by removing the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element.
4. For each new window, check if the average meets the threshold and update the result accordingly.

---

**Solution:**

```java
public static int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
    int result = 0;
    int sum = 0;

    // Compute the sum of the first sub-array of size k
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }

    // Check if the average of the first sub-array meets the threshold
    if ((int) sum / k >= threshold) result++;

    // Slide the window across the array
    for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
        sum -= arr[i - k];  // Remove the element that goes out of the window
        sum += arr[i];      // Add the new element that comes into the window

        // Check if the average of the current window meets the threshold
        if ((int) sum / k >= threshold) result++;
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We process each element exactly once, making the algorithm linear.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we only use a few variables to track the sum and the result.

---

**Edge Cases:**

1. If `k == arr.length`, then we only have one sub-array to consider.
2. If all elements in the array are equal to or less than the threshold, the result will be 0.
3. If the array is smaller than `k`, the problem constraints guarantee this won't happen as `k <= arr.length`.
