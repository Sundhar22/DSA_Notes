[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

---

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
- `s = "abcabcbb"`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** 
- The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
- `s = "bbbbb"`

**Output:** `1`

**Explanation:** 
- The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

---

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 
- `s = "pwwkew"`

**Output:** `3`

**Explanation:** 
- The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

**Approach:**

1. Use a sliding window technique with two pointers (`st` and `end`) to track the current substring without repeating characters.
2. Maintain a `HashSet` to store characters that are already in the current window.
3. For each character at index `end` in the string:
   - If the character is already in the set (indicating a repeating character), shrink the window by moving the `st` pointer to the right until the repeating character is removed.
   - Add the current character to the set and update the maximum length of the substring.
4. Continue this process until the entire string has been processed.

**Solution:**

```java
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
    if (s.length() == 0 || s == null) return 0;
    
    HashSet<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
    int longestString = 0;

    for (int st = 0, end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
        char c = s.charAt(end);

        // If character is already in the set, move 'st' to the right
        while (set.contains(c)) {
            set.remove(s.charAt(st));
            st++;
        }

        // Add the new character to the set
        set.add(c);

        // Update the length of the longest substring
        longestString = Math.max(longestString, end - st + 1);
    }

    return longestString;
}
```

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice (once added to the set, once removed).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(min(n, m))`, where `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the size of the character set. The `HashSet` can hold at most the number of unique characters in the substring.

---

**Edge Cases:**

1. If `s` is empty, return 0.
2. If all characters are the same, the longest substring will be of length 1.
3. The string can have a mix of unique and repeated characters, so the sliding window needs to adapt accordingly.
