[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate-ii/description/
)

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that:
- `nums[i] == nums[j]`, and
- `abs(i - j) <= k`.

Otherwise, return `false`.

---

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`, `k = 3`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:** 
- There are two indices `i = 0` and `j = 3` where `nums[0] == nums[3]` and `abs(0 - 3) = 3`, which is less than or equal to `k`.

---

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,0,1,1]`, `k = 1`

**Output:** `true`

**Explanation:** 
- The indices `i = 2` and `j = 3` satisfy `nums[2] == nums[3]` and `abs(2 - 3) = 1`.

---

**Example 3:**

**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3]`, `k = 2`

**Output:** `false`

**Explanation:** 
- Although there are duplicates, no two indices have a difference less than or equal to `k`.

---

**Approach:**

1. Use a HashMap to store each element of the array along with its most recent index.
2. As you iterate through the array, check if the current number already exists in the HashMap:
   - If it exists, check whether the difference between the current index and the previous index of this number is less than or equal to `k`.
   - If so, return `true` immediately.
   - If not, update the index of the number in the HashMap.
3. If no such pair is found after checking all elements, return `false`.

---

**Solution:**

```java
public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
    HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();  // To store the element and its last seen index

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // If the element is already in the map and the difference between indices is <= k
        if (map.containsKey(nums[i]) && Math.abs(map.get(nums[i]) - i) <= k) {
            return true;  // Found the condition
        }
        // Update the index of the current element
        map.put(nums[i], i);
    }
    return false;  // No such pair found
}
```

---

**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, and both the insertion and lookup in the HashMap are `O(1)` on average.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we store each element of the array along with its index in the HashMap.

---

**Edge Cases:**

- The array has only one element, so no duplicates can exist.
- All elements in the array are unique, so the function will return `false`.
- There are duplicates, but none satisfy the condition `abs(i - j) <= k`.
