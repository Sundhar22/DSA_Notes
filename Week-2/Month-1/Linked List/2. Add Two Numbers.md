[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/)

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. You need to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

**Assumptions:**
- The two numbers do not contain any leading zeros, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** 
- `l1 = [2,4,3]` 
- `l2 = [5,6,4]`

**Output:** 
- `[7,0,8]`

**Explanation:** 342 + 465 = 807. The linked list `[7,0,8]` represents the sum in reverse order.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** 
- `l1 = [0]` 
- `l2 = [0]`

**Output:** 
- `[0]`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** 
- `l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9]` 
- `l2 = [9,9,9,9]`

**Output:** 
- `[8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]`

**Approach:**

1. **Initialize variables:** We use a `carry` variable to keep track of any overflow during the sum of digits.
2. **Traverse both linked lists:** Add corresponding digits from `l1` and `l2` along with the carry from the previous operation.
3. **Create new nodes:** Each time, we create a new node with the value of the sum modulo 10, and update the carry to be the sum divided by 10.
4. **Handle remaining carry:** If there is a carry left after both lists are processed, append a new node with that carry value.
5. **Return the result linked list** starting from the node next to the dummy head.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode cur = new ListNode(), ret = cur;
        int c = 0; // 'c' is the carry value
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null) {
            int a = (l1 == null) ? 0 : l1.val; // Handle null cases by assigning 0
            int b = (l2 == null) ? 0 : l2.val;
            int sum = a + b + c; // Sum of digits and carry
            cur.next = new ListNode(sum % 10); // Create node for sum's last digit
            c = sum / 10; // Update carry
            cur = cur.next; // Move to the next node
            if (l1 != null) l1 = l1.next;
            if (l2 != null) l2 = l2.next;
        }
        if (c != 0) cur.next = new ListNode(c); // Handle leftover carry
        return ret.next; // Return the sum list starting from the next node of the dummy head
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- Both linked lists have different lengths. The shorter list is padded with zeros.
- The sum of the last digits results in a carry, requiring an extra node at the end.
- One or both linked lists contain the value `0`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(max(m, n))` where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `l1` and `l2`, respectively. We traverse both lists once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(max(m, n))` since we create a new linked list that has at most one more node than the longer of the two input lists.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- One common mistake is forgetting to handle different-length linked lists, which can lead to null pointer exceptions. Ensure to check if the nodes are null before accessing their values.
- Remember to handle the carry after processing both linked lists, as this can result in an additional node.

**Alternate Solutions:**
- **Recursive Approach:** A recursive approach can be used to add digits from the two lists along with the carry. However, this can lead to higher memory usage due to the function call stack.
- **Array-Based Approach:** If the problem allowed, we could convert the numbers to arrays, perform the sum, and convert the result back to a linked list. However, this defeats the purpose of using linked lists for the problem.
