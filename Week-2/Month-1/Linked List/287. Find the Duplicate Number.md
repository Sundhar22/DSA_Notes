[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers, where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive, there is exactly one repeated number. Your task is to return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All integers in `nums` appear only once except for exactly one integer that appears two or more times.

**Follow-up:**

- Can you prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
- Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

**Approach:**

This problem can be solved using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) algorithm. The idea is to treat the array as a linked list where each element points to the next element at the index `nums[i]`. Since there is one duplicate number, it creates a cycle in the "linked list". The goal is to find the start of the cycle, which is the repeated number.

**Steps:**

1. **Phase 1 (Detecting the cycle):**
   - Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. Initially, both are set to the first element in the array.
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time (`slow = nums[slow]`) and the `fast` pointer two steps at a time (`fast = nums[nums[fast]]`).
   - Continue this process until `slow` equals `fast`, indicating a cycle exists.

2. **Phase 2 (Finding the entry point of the cycle):**
   - Reset the `slow` pointer to the beginning of the array (`slow = nums[0]`).
   - Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the start of the cycle, which is the duplicate number.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize slow and fast pointers
        int fast = nums[0], slow = nums[0];
        
        // Phase 1: Detect the cycle
        do {
            slow = nums[slow];        // Slow moves one step
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];  // Fast moves two steps
        } while (slow != fast);
        
        // Phase 2: Find the entry point of the cycle (duplicate number)
        slow = nums[0];  // Reset slow pointer to the start
        
        // Move both slow and fast one step at a time until they meet
        while (fast != slow) {
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        
        // Return the duplicate number
        return fast;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**

- All numbers are the same except one, e.g., `nums = [3,3,3,3,3]`.
- The duplicate is at the beginning or the end of the array.
  
**Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. The two-pointer technique ensures we traverse the array a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as no extra space is used apart from the two pointers.

**Mistakes and Learning:**

- A common mistake is trying to solve the problem using sorting or a hash set, which either modifies the array or uses extra space. The key challenge is to solve the problem in constant space without modifying the input array.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Binary Search Approach:** We can use a binary search on the range `[1, n]` to find the duplicate by counting how many numbers in the array are less than or equal to the mid-point of the range. This solution also runs in `O(n log n)` time and uses `O(1)` space but is slightly more complex to implement.
