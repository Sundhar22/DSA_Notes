### [Problem Description:](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/description/)

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head. The problem can be solved in multiple ways, but we aim for a one-pass solution.

### Example 1:

**Input:** 
`head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2`

**Output:** 
`[1,2,3,5]`

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
`head = [1], n = 1`

**Output:** 
`[]`

### Example 3:

**Input:** 
`head = [1,2], n = 1`

**Output:** 
`[1]`

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is between 1 and 30.
- Each node’s value is between 0 and 100.
- 1 ≤ n ≤ the size of the list.

---

### Approach:

We can use two different methods to solve this problem. One is using a reverse technique, and the other is using a two-pointer technique, which is more efficient.

### Solution 1 (Initial Approach):

```java
public static ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    if (head.next == null && n == 1)
        return null;

    ListNode reversedList = reverse(head);
    ListNode dummyNode = new ListNode(0);
    dummyNode.next = reversedList;

    int i = 1;
    ListNode current = dummyNode;
    while (current != null) {
        if (i == n) {
            if (current.next != null) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                current.next = null;
            }
            break;
        }
        current = current.next;
        i++;
    }

    head = reverse(dummyNode.next);
    return head;
}

private static ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
    ListNode prev = null;
    while (head != null) {
        ListNode nextNode = head.next;
        head.next = prev;
        prev = head;
        head = nextNode;
    }
    return prev;
}
```

### Explanation of Solution 1:

1. **Reversing the Linked List**: We first reverse the linked list, then remove the nth node from the reversed list, and finally reverse it back to its original order.
2. **Removing the Node**: Once reversed, we traverse to the nth node and update pointers to skip over it.
3. **Reverse the List Again**: After removing the node, we reverse the list back to return the final list.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list (due to the two reversals).
- **Space**: O(1), no additional space is used except for pointers.

---

### **Alternative Approach** (Two-Pointer Technique, One-Pass Solution):

In this approach, we use two pointers to traverse the linked list in one pass and efficiently remove the nth node from the end.

### Solution 2 (Two-Pointer Approach):

```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode first = dummy;
    ListNode second = dummy;

    // Move first pointer n steps ahead
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        first = first.next;
    }

    // Move both pointers until the first pointer reaches the end
    while (first != null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }

    // Remove the nth node from the end
    second.next = second.next.next;

    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Explanation of Solution 2:

1. **Dummy Node**: We introduce a dummy node before the head of the list to handle edge cases (like removing the first node) smoothly.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: 
   - Move the `first` pointer n+1 steps ahead.
   - Keep the `second` pointer at the head.
   - Now move both pointers one step at a time until the `first` pointer reaches the end of the list.
3. **Remove the Node**: The `second` pointer will now be just before the nth node from the end, and we can easily remove the target node by updating the next pointer of the `second` pointer.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time**: O(n), since we only traverse the list once.
- **Space**: O(1), no extra space is used except for pointers.

### Pros and Cons of Both Approaches:

| Approach                | Pros                                      | Cons                             |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Reversal Approach**    | Simple, direct manipulation of nodes      | Requires reversing twice         |
| **Two-Pointer Approach** | Efficient, one-pass solution              | Slightly trickier to understand  |

---

### Conclusion:

- The **two-pointer approach** is more efficient and elegant since it achieves the task in **one pass**.
- The **reversal approach** works fine, but it has additional complexity due to the need for two reversals.
- Both approaches ensure that the problem is solved within **O(n) time** and **O(1) space**.
