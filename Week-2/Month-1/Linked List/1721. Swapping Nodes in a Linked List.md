### [Problem Description:](https://leetcode.com/problems/swapping-nodes-in-a-linked-list/description/)
You are given the head of a singly-linked list and an integer `k`. The task is to swap the values of the kth node from the beginning and the kth node from the end of the list (the list is 1-indexed).

### Example 1:

![[Pasted image 20240909212552.png]]

**Input:** 
```
head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
```
**Output:** 
```
[1,4,3,2,5]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
```
head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5
```
**Output:** 
```
[7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]
```

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= k <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

### Approach:

To solve the problem efficiently, we can traverse the list twice:

1. **First Traversal:** Find the `k`th node from the beginning.
2. **Second Traversal:** Find the `k`th node from the end by starting another pointer when we reach the `k`th node from the beginning.
3. **Swap Values:** Swap the values of the nodes found in both traversals.

### Solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        ListNode first = head, second = head;

        // Move 'first' pointer to the k-th node
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            first = first.next;
        }
        ListNode firstNode = first;

        // Move 'first' to the end while moving 'second' to the k-th node from the end
        while (first.next != null) {
            first = first.next;
            second = second.next;
        }

        // Swap values of the firstNode and second (k-th node from the end)
        int temp = firstNode.val;
        firstNode.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;

        return head;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Find the k-th Node from the Beginning:**
   - Move the `first` pointer `k-1` steps forward to reach the `k`th node from the beginning.
2. **Find the k-th Node from the End:**
   - After reaching the `k`th node from the start, start moving both `first` and `second` pointers until `first` reaches the end of the list. At this point, `second` will point to the `k`th node from the end.
3. **Swap Values:** Swap the values of the nodes pointed by `firstNode` and `second`.
4. **Return the Updated List.**

---

### Alternative Approach (Two-Pass Solution):

This solution uses two separate traversals: one to find the length of the list and the positions of the `k`th nodes from the start and the end, and another to swap their values.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        int n = 0;
        ListNode first = head, second = head;

        // First pass to find the total length of the list
        while (first != null) {
            n++;
            first = first.next;
        }

        // Find the k-th node from the beginning
        first = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            first = first.next;
        }

        // Find the k-th node from the end (n - k + 1)
        second = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < (n - k + 1); i++) {
            second = second.next;
        }

        // Swap values of first and second nodes
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;

        return head;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Alternative Approach:

1. **Calculate List Length:** First pass to find the total number of nodes in the list.
2. **Find the Nodes:** 
   - `k`th node from the beginning is found by moving `first` pointer `k` steps.
   - `k`th node from the end is found by moving `second` pointer `n-k+1` steps.
3. **Swap the Values:** Swap the values between the two identified nodes.
4. **Return the Updated List.**

### Time Complexity:

- Both approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)** since we traverse the list at most twice.

### Space Complexity:

- Both approaches use **O(1)** additional space as we are only using pointers to traverse the list.
