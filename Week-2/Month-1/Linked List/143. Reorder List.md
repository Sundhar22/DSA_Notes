[### **Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)

You are given the head of a singly linked list, which can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

You need to reorder the list into the following pattern:

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You **cannot modify** the values in the list's nodes, only rearrange the nodes themselves.

### **Example 1:**

![[Pasted image 20240909145248.png]]
**Input:** 
``` 
head = [1, 2, 3, 4] 
```

**Output:** 
``` 
[1, 4, 2, 3] 
```

### **Example 2:**

![[Pasted image 20240909145259.png]]

**Input:** 
``` 
head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
```

**Output:** 
``` 
[1, 5, 2, 4, 3] 
```

---

### **Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

---

### **Approach:**

This problem can be solved in three main steps:

1. **Find the middle of the linked list:**  
   Use the **fast and slow pointer** technique to find the middle of the list. The slow pointer will be at the midpoint when the fast pointer reaches the end of the list.
   
2. **Reverse the second half of the list:**  
   Once the middle is found, reverse the second half of the list to prepare it for interleaving with the first half.

3. **Merge both halves:**  
   After reversing the second half, merge the two halves by alternating nodes from the first and second halves.

---

### **Solution:**

```java
public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return;
    
    // Step 1: Find the middle of the list
    ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }
    
    // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
    ListNode prev = null, curr = slow, temp;
    while (curr != null) {
        temp = curr.next;
        curr.next = prev;
        prev = curr;
        curr = temp;
    }
    
    // Step 3: Merge the two halves
    ListNode first = head, second = prev;
    while (second.next != null) {
        temp = first.next;
        first.next = second;
        first = temp;
        
        temp = second.next;
        second.next = first;
        second = temp;
    }
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Find the middle of the list:**
   - Use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`. The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.
   
2. **Reverse the second half:**
   - Start from the node next to the middle and reverse the rest of the list.
   
3. **Merge the two halves:**
   - Alternate nodes from the first half and the reversed second half to achieve the desired order.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  - **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes. Finding the middle, reversing the second half, and merging the two halves each takes linear time.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - **O(1)** since the reordering is done in place and no extra space is used except for a few pointers.

---

This solution ensures that the nodes are rearranged efficiently in linear time while maintaining constant space usage.
