[### **Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-twin-sum-of-a-linked-list/)

In a linked list of size `n` (where `n` is even), the **twin** of a node `i` is defined as the node at index `n - 1 - i`. The **twin sum** is defined as the sum of a node and its twin.

Given the head of a linked list with even length, return the **maximum twin sum** of the linked list.

---

### **Example 1:**

**Input:**

``` 
head = [5, 4, 2, 1]
```

**Output:**

``` 
6
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `0` (5) is the twin of node `3` (1): twin sum = 5 + 1 = 6.
- Node `1` (4) is the twin of node `2` (2): twin sum = 4 + 2 = 6.
- The maximum twin sum is `6`.

---

### **Example 2:**

**Input:**

``` 
head = [4, 2, 2, 3]
```

**Output:**

``` 
7
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `0` (4) is the twin of node `3` (3): twin sum = 4 + 3 = 7.
- Node `1` (2) is the twin of node `2` (2): twin sum = 2 + 2 = 4.
- The maximum twin sum is `7`.

---

### **Example 3:**

**Input:**

``` 
head = [1, 100000]
```

**Output:**

``` 
100001
```

**Explanation:**

- Node `0` (1) is the twin of node `1` (100000): twin sum = 1 + 100000 = 100001.
- The maximum twin sum is `100001`.

---

### **Approach:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum sum of pairs of nodes such that each node is paired with its twin. The twin of a node `i` is the node at index `n - 1 - i`.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Two-pointer technique with recursion:**
    - Use a recursive approach to traverse the linked list with two pointers: one pointer (`fast`) moves two steps forward and another pointer (`slow`) moves one step forward.
    - Once the `fast` pointer reaches the end, the recursion will return the center node of the list.
    - At each recursive step, we calculate the twin sum by adding the value of the `slow` pointer to the value of its twin node (which is returned from recursion). Keep track of the maximum twin sum.

2. **Maximization of the twin sums:**
    - As we traverse the list recursively, we update the maximum twin sum encountered so far.

---

### **Solution:**

```java
public class PairSum {
    int max = 0;

    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        // Start the recursive helper function
        pairSumHelper(head, head);
        // Return the maximum twin sum
        return this.max;
    }

    // Recursive function to traverse the list and calculate twin sums
    private ListNode pairSumHelper(ListNode slow, ListNode fast) {
        // Base case: when fast reaches the end of the list, return the next node after slow
        if (fast.next == null) return slow.next;

        // Recursive call to go deeper in the list
        ListNode centerNode = pairSumHelper(slow.next, fast.next.next);

        // Calculate the twin sum and update the max twin sum
        max = Math.max(max, slow.val + centerNode.val);

        // Return the next node after the current center node
        return centerNode.next;
    }
}
```

---

### **Explanation:**

1. **Recursive Helper Function (`pairSumHelper`)**:
    - It receives two pointers, `slow` and `fast`.
    - The `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time, and the recursion proceeds until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
    - At each step in recursion, we calculate the twin sum using the `slow` pointer and the node returned by the recursive call (which is the twin of the current `slow` node).

2. **Maximizing Twin Sum**:
    - We compare the current twin sum with the `max` variable and update it if the new sum is larger.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The recursion traverses the list once, and each node is processed in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - `O(n)` due to the recursion stack. Each recursive call adds one frame to the stack until it reaches the center of the list.

---
**Alternative Approach:**

Another approach to solve this problem is by reversing the second half of the linked list and then iterating through both halves to compute the twin sum. This avoids the need for recursion and can be done in O(n) time with O(1) extra space.

**Steps:**

1. Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list.
3. Iterate through both halves of the list simultaneously and calculate the twin sum.
4. Track the maximum twin sum encountered during the iteration.

```java
public class PairSum {
    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list using the slow and fast pointer technique
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the list
        ListNode prev = null;
        while (slow != null) {
            ListNode nextNode = slow.next;
            slow.next = prev;
            prev = slow;
            slow = nextNode;
        }

        // Step 3: Iterate through both halves and compute the maximum twin sum
        ListNode firstHalf = head, secondHalf = prev;
        int maxTwinSum = 0;
        while (secondHalf != null) {
            maxTwinSum = Math.max(maxTwinSum, firstHalf.val + secondHalf.val);
            firstHalf = firstHalf.next;
            secondHalf = secondHalf.next;
        }

        return maxTwinSum;
    }
}
```
