[[DeleteNodeInA_BST.excalidraw]] - **diagram**

[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/)

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST. The deletion process involves two stages:
1. Search for the node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node while maintaining the BST property.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
- **Output:** [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
- **Explanation:** The node with value 3 is deleted, and either of the valid resulting trees ([5,4,6,2,null,null,7] or [5,2,6,null,4,null,7]) is accepted.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
- **Output:** [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
- **Explanation:** The tree does not contain a node with value 0, so no changes are made.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** root = [], key = 0
- **Output:** []

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`.
- Each node has a unique value.
- The root is a valid binary search tree.
- `-10^5 <= key <= 10^5`.

**Approach:**
1. **Recursive Search:** 
   - If the key is smaller than the root's value, search the left subtree.
   - If the key is larger, search the right subtree.
   - When the node to be deleted is found:
     - If it has only one child or no children, directly replace the node with its child (or `null`).
     - If it has two children, find the in-order successor (the smallest node in the right subtree), replace the node's value with the successor's value, and recursively delete the successor node.
  
**Solution:**

```java
public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {  
    if (root==null) return null;  
    if (key< root.val){  
        // in every node return node we need to attach because when it reaches  
        // any one side is one side is null then directly attach another then it gives child node        root.left= deleteNode(root.left,key);  
    } else if (key>root.val) {  
        // in every node return node we need to attach because when it reaches  
        // any one side is one side is null then directly attach another then it gives child node        root.right= deleteNode(root.right,key);  
    }else {  
	        // con-1 if any one side is one side is null then directly attach another  
	        if (root.left==null) return root.right;  
	        if (root.right==null) return root.left;  
	  
	        // con-2 if there is two children then find the greatest deep low                node and replace the value  
	        TreeNode node = findLow(root.right);  
	        root.val= node.val;  
	  
	        // we are making the  deep low node (successor) to balance by  reaching either con-1 or setting null  and key = deep low node value  
	        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, node.val);  
	  
    }  
  
    return root;
}  
  
private TreeNode findLow(TreeNode node) {  
    // finding the deepest low value node  
    while (node.left!=null) node=node.left;  
    return node;  
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- The key does not exist in the tree (no deletion is performed).
- The node to delete is the root node.
- The tree has only one node.
---
**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, `h = O(n)` for a skewed tree, but in a balanced tree, `h = O(log n)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)` due to the recursive stack, where `h` is the height of the tree.
---
**Mistakes and Learning:**
- It's easy to forget about the different cases for the node with two children (in-order successor).
- Ensuring all recursive calls correctly return the updated tree is crucial.
---
**Alternate Solutions:**
- **Iterative Approach:** Instead of recursion, an iterative solution could be used to traverse the tree and handle deletions. This would have the same time complexity but avoids the space overhead of recursion.
