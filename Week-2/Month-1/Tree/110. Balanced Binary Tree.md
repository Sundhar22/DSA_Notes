[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced. A binary tree is considered balanced if for every node in the tree, the height difference between its left and right subtrees is no more than 1.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** The tree is balanced because the height difference between any node’s left and right subtrees is at most 1.

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
- **Output:** false
- **Explanation:** The tree is not balanced because the height difference between some nodes’ left and right subtrees exceeds 1.

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** root = []
- **Output:** true
- **Explanation:** An empty tree is considered balanced.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`

**Approach:**

- **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS):**  
  The algorithm uses a recursive DFS approach to check if the tree is balanced. For each node:
  1. Compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
  2. Check if the absolute difference in heights is greater than 1.
  3. If either subtree is unbalanced, propagate the imbalance up the tree.
  4. Return the height of the current subtree if balanced, otherwise return `-1` to indicate imbalance.

**Solution:**

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return isBalancedHelper(root) != -1;
    }

    private int isBalancedHelper(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0; // Base case: height of an empty subtree is 0

        // Recursively get the height of left subtree
        int leftHeight = isBalancedHelper(node.left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) return -1; // Unbalanced subtree
        
        // Recursively get the height of right subtree
        int rightHeight = isBalancedHelper(node.right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) return -1; // Unbalanced subtree

        // Check if the current subtree is balanced
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) return -1; // Current subtree is unbalanced

        // Return the height of the current node's subtree
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- The tree is empty (`root == null`), which is considered balanced, so the output should be `true`.
- The tree has only one node, which is also balanced.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height could be `O(n)`.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- Ensure that the function correctly returns `-1` when a subtree is unbalanced and propagates this information upwards.
- Carefully handle the case where both left and right subtrees are null to avoid incorrect height calculations.

**Alternate Solutions:**
- **Iterative Approach:** While the recursive approach is straightforward and easy to implement, an iterative approach using a stack could be more complex but avoids deep recursion issues. This approach would involve manually managing the traversal and height calculations.
