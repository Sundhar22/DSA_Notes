[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree by swapping the left and right children of each node, and return the root of the inverted tree.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
- **Output:** [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** root = [2,1,3]
- **Output:** [2,3,1]

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** root = []
- **Output:** []

**Approach:**

- **Recursive Inversion:**  
  The tree inversion process is recursive. For each node:
  1. Swap the left and right children.
  2. Recursively invert the left and right subtrees.

**Solution:**

```java
public class Solution {
    private void invertTreeHelper(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Swap left and right children
        TreeNode temp = root.left;
        root.left = root.right;
        root.right = temp;

        // Recursively invert left and right subtrees
        if (root.left != null) {
            invertTree(root.left);
        }
        if (root.right != null) {
            invertTree(root.right);
        }
    }

    public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        invertTreeHelper(root);
        return root;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- The input tree is empty (root is `null`), so the output should be `null`.
- The tree has only one node, in which case no changes are made.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, `h = O(n)` for a skewed tree, but in a balanced tree, `h = O(log n)`.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- It is important to ensure that the recursion correctly handles the base case where the node is `null`, preventing unnecessary operations on empty nodes.
- Ensure that both left and right subtrees are inverted recursively after swapping.

**Alternate Solutions:**
- **Iterative Approach (Using a Queue):** You could solve this problem iteratively using a queue to perform a breadth-first traversal, swapping the children of each node as you go. This approach has the same time complexity but avoids the recursion depth limit.
  
**Iterative Solution Example:**

```java
public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return null;

    Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
    queue.add(root);

    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode current = queue.poll();

        // Swap the left and right children
        TreeNode temp = current.left;
        current.left = current.right;
        current.right = temp;

        // Add the children to the queue if they exist
        if (current.left != null) {
            queue.add(current.left);
        }
        if (current.right != null) {
            queue.add(current.right);
        }
    }
    return root;
}
```

This iterative solution has a **Time Complexity** of `O(n)` and a **Space Complexity** of `O(n)` due to the queue.
