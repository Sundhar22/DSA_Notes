[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth. The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** The maximum depth is 3 (from root 3 to leaves 15 or 7).

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** root = [1,null,2]
- **Output:** 2

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Approach:**

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  
  The algorithm performs a level-order traversal using a queue to explore each level of the tree. The depth is incremented each time a new level of nodes is processed.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
   public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0; // Base case: if the tree is empty
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        int count = 0;
        
        // BFS to traverse each level
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Queue<TreeNode> innerQueue = new LinkedList<>();
            count++; // Increment depth for each level
            
            // Process all nodes at the current level
            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                TreeNode fnt = queue.poll();
                
                // Add children to the next level queue
                if (fnt.left != null) innerQueue.add(fnt.left);
                if (fnt.right != null) innerQueue.add(fnt.right);
            }

            queue = innerQueue; // Move to the next level
        }
        
        return count; // Return the total depth
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- The tree is empty (`root == null`), so the depth should be `0`.
- The tree has only one node (the root), so the depth is `1`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed once during the BFS.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(w)`, where `w` is the maximum width of the tree (the largest number of nodes at any level). In the worst case, this is `O(n)` for a completely balanced tree.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- One common mistake is to forget to increment the depth counter (`count`) at the start of each level's processing. Itâ€™s essential to do so at the beginning of each level in BFS.
- Ensuring that all child nodes are correctly added to the next level's queue is critical for BFS traversal.

**Alternate Solutions:**

- **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS):**
  Instead of using BFS, you can solve the problem recursively by calculating the depth of the left and right subtrees, then returning the maximum of the two depths plus one (for the current node).

**DFS Recursive Solution Example:**

```java
class Solution {
   public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
       if (root == null) return 0;
       int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
       int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);
       return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
   }
}
```

This recursive approach has the same **Time Complexity** of `O(n)` but has a **Space Complexity** of `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack.
