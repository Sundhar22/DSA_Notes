[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree, and this path may or may not pass through the root. The length of the path is defined as the number of edges between two nodes.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5]
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** The diameter is 3, corresponding to the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** root = [1,2]
- **Output:** 1

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

**Approach:**

- **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS):**  
  To calculate the diameter, we need to find the longest path between any two nodes, which may pass through the root. The key insight is that for any node, the longest path through that node is the sum of the depths of its left and right subtrees.

- **Algorithm Steps:**
  1. For each node, recursively calculate the height of the left and right subtrees.
  2. Update the diameter to be the maximum of its current value or the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
  3. Return the height of the current subtree to the parent node.

**Solution:**

```java
public class DiameterOfBinaryTree {
    int diameter = 0; // Initialize the global diameter

    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        DOFTHelper(root); // Recursively compute the diameter
        return diameter;  // Return the final computed diameter
    }

    private int DOFTHelper(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0; // Base case: null node has a height of 0
        }
        
        // Recursively get the height of left and right subtrees
        int l = DOFTHelper(node.left);
        int r = DOFTHelper(node.right);
        
        // Update the global diameter to be the maximum diameter so far
        diameter = Math.max(diameter, r + l);
        
        // Return the height of the current node's subtree
        return Math.max(r, l) + 1;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- If the tree consists of a single node, the diameter is `0` since there are no edges.
- For a tree with no nodes (`root == null`), the diameter should be `0`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), the height could be `O(n)`.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- One mistake could be thinking the diameter is the sum of the depths of left and right subtrees without updating the global `diameter` variable properly. It is important to update `diameter` after calculating the sum of the left and right subtree heights.

**Alternate Solutions:**
- This problem can only be effectively solved using a recursive approach. An iterative approach would be more complex and less intuitive.

**Explanation of Key Points:**
- The helper function `DOFTHelper` returns the height of the current node's subtree but also updates the global `diameter` variable with the largest path (left height + right height) encountered during the traversal. This ensures that the final `diameter` is the maximum path length between any two nodes in the tree.
