[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/)  

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`. A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region. A region is surrounded if it is completely enclosed by `'X'`s, i.e., there are no `'O'`s on the border of the board.

**Example 1:**  

**Input:**  
```
board = [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","O","X"],
         ["X","X","O","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

**Output:**  
```
board = [["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","X","X","X"],
         ["X","O","X","X"]]
```

**Explanation:**  
Surrounded regions should not be on the border, which means that any `'O'` connected to the border `'O'` will not be flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that isn't connected to the border `'O'` will be flipped to `'X'`.

**Approach:**  
1. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify `'O'`s that are connected to the border. These `'O'`s cannot be captured.
2. Replace all `'O'`s connected to the border with a temporary character (e.g., `'T'`) to mark them.
3. Iterate through the board:
   - Replace `'T'` with `'O'` (these are the safe regions not to be captured).
   - Replace all other `'O'`s with `'X'` (these are the captured regions).
4. This approach ensures that only the `'O'`s not connected to the border are captured.

**Solution:**  
```java
class Solution {
    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;

        // Mark border-connected 'O's using DFS
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (board[0][i] == 'O') DFS(board, 0, i);
            if (board[m - 1][i] == 'O') DFS(board, m - 1, i);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] == 'O') DFS(board, i, 0);
            if (board[i][n - 1] == 'O') DFS(board, i, n - 1);
        }

        // Flip captured regions
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'T') {
                    board[i][j] = 'O';
                } else {
                    board[i][j] = 'X';
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private void DFS(char[][] board, int x, int y) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || board[x][y] != 'O') return;
        board[x][y] = 'T';
        int[][] dir = {{1, 0}, {0, 1}, {-1, 0}, {0, -1}};
        for (int[] d : dir) {
            int r = x + d[0], c = y + d[1];
            DFS(board, r, c);
        }
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**  
- An empty board (`board.length == 0`).
- All cells are `'X'`.
- All cells are `'O'`.

**Complexity Analysis:**  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each cell is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` in the worst case due to the DFS call stack.

**Mistakes and Learning:**  
- The common mistake is to flip all `'O'`s without considering whether they are connected to the border.
- Ensure to only mark border-connected `'O'`s and handle them separately.

**Alternate Solutions:**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Similar to DFS, but uses a queue to mark the border-connected `'O'`s.
- **Union-Find:** A more complex approach where cells are unioned into groups to determine which `'O'`s are connected to the border.
