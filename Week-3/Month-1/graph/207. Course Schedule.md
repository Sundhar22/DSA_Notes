**[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/description/):**

You are given `numCourses` and a list of prerequisites where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `bi` before course `ai`. Determine if you can finish all courses. 

This problem can be modeled as a graph problem where courses are nodes and prerequisites are directed edges. The goal is to check if the graph has any cycles. If there are cycles, you can't complete the courses because you would end up in an infinite loop of prerequisites.

**Approach:**

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Populate the adjacency list with the given prerequisites.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph.
   - Track the state of each node: 
     - `0` for unvisited,
     - `1` for visiting (part of the current path),
     - `2` for visited (part of a successful path).

3. **DFS Implementation:**
   - If a node is currently being visited (`state[i] == 1`), a cycle is detected.
   - If a node has already been fully processed (`state[i] == 2`), skip it.
   - Otherwise, mark the node as visiting and explore all its neighbors recursively.

**Solution:**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        Map<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> adj = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Build the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            adj.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
            adj.get(prerequisite[0]).add(prerequisite[1]);
        }
        
        int[] state = new int[numCourses];
        
        // Check for cycles in each component
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (state[i] == 0) {
                if (!dfs(adj, i, state)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    private boolean dfs(Map<Integer, ArrayList<Integer>> adj, int i, int[] state) {
        if (state[i] == 1) return false;  // Cycle detected
        if (state[i] == 2) return true;   // Already processed

        state[i] = 1;  // Mark as visiting
        for (Integer neighbor : adj.get(i)) {
            if (!dfs(adj, neighbor, state)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        state[i] = 2;  // Mark as visited
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**
- No prerequisites: Return `true` as there are no dependencies.
- All courses are interconnected with a single cycle: Return `false`.
- Large input sizes to test efficiency.

**Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of courses (nodes) and `E` is the number of prerequisites (edges). Each node and edge is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V + E)`, for the adjacency list and state array.

**Mistakes and Learning:**
- Ensure to use a consistent and efficient approach for cycle detection to handle large inputs effectively.
- Avoid recreating data structures like `HashSet` within recursive calls to prevent excessive overhead.

**Alternate Solutions:**
- **Kahnâ€™s Algorithm:** An iterative approach using in-degrees to detect cycles and perform topological sorting. This can be more space-efficient but is generally less intuitive than DFS for this specific problem.
