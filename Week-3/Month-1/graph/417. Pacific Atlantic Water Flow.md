[**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/pacific-atlantic-water-flow/)

Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, determine all coordinates from which water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) and can only flow from a cell to another one with an equal or lower height.

**Understanding:**  
Think of this problem as a valley surrounded by two rivers (Pacific and Atlantic). The water flows from the top of the hills down to the valleys, connecting paths that lead to both rivers. The goal is to find all such paths that connect both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `heights = [[1,2,2,3,5],[3,2,3,4,4],[2,4,5,3,1],[6,7,1,4,5],[5,1,1,2,4]]`
  
**Output:** `[[0,4],[1,3],[1,4],[2,2],[3,0],[3,1],[4,0]]`

**Explanation:** 
- The Atlantic Ocean touches the bottom and right edges of the matrix.
- The Pacific Ocean touches the top and left edges of the matrix.
- The resulting list is the coordinates from which water can flow to both oceans.

**Approach:**  
- Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore paths from each ocean.
- Start from the edges of the matrix where the Pacific and Atlantic oceans touch.
- For each cell, explore adjacent cells with a DFS, marking cells that can reach the respective ocean.
- Finally, find cells that can reach both oceans by checking intersections of paths that reach the Pacific and the Atlantic.

**Solution:**  
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pacificAtlantic(int[][] heights) {
        List<List<Integer>> pathHolder = new ArrayList<>();
        if (heights == null || heights.length == 0 || heights[0].length == 0) return pathHolder;

        int m = heights.length, n = heights[0].length;
        boolean[][] pac = new boolean[m][n], atl = new boolean[m][n];

        // Traverse from Pacific (top and left)
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            dfs(heights, pac, 0, col); // Top row
            dfs(heights, atl, m - 1, col); // Bottom row
        }
        for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            dfs(heights, pac, row, 0); // Left column
            dfs(heights, atl, row, n - 1); // Right column
        }

        // Collect cells that can reach both oceans
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (pac[i][j] && atl[i][j]) {
                    List<Integer> cell = new ArrayList<>();
                    cell.add(i);
                    cell.add(j);
                    pathHolder.add(cell);
                }
            }
        }
        return pathHolder;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] heights, boolean[][] visited, int r, int c) {
        int m = heights.length, n = heights[0].length;
        visited[r][c] = true;
        int[][] dir = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        for (int[] d : dir) {
            int nr = r + d[0], nc = c + d[1];

            if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n && !visited[nr][nc] && heights[nr][nc] >= heights[r][c]) {
                dfs(heights, visited, nr, nc);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Edge Cases:**  
- The matrix is empty, so the output should be an empty list.
- All cells have the same height.
- The matrix has only one row or one column.

**Complexity Analysis:**  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We traverse each cell multiple times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, due to the space used by the `visited` arrays and the call stack in DFS.

**Mistakes and Learning:**  
- Ensure that the DFS doesn't revisit cells unnecessarily.
- Use appropriate boundary conditions to avoid index errors.

**Alternate Solutions:**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Could be used instead of DFS for exploring paths from the oceans. This approach can be more intuitive for some scenarios.
- **Union-Find:** An advanced approach where we can union cells that connect to the oceans, though it might be more complex to implement in this specific problem.
