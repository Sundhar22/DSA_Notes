### [**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/description/)

You are given an integer array `nums` where each element represents your maximum jump length at that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps. You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index `0` to `1`, then 3 steps to the last index.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [2,3,0,1,4]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index `0` to `1`, then 3 steps to the last index.

### **Approach:**

- Use a greedy approach to track the farthest reachable index (`reachable`) at each step.
- Maintain an `end` variable to denote the current range of jumps.
- Once you reach the end of the current range, increment the jump count and update `end` to `reachable`.
- Stop the process when `end` reaches or exceeds the last index.

---

### **Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public int jump(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 1) return 0;
        
        int reachable = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int jump = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            reachable = Math.max(reachable, i + nums[i]);

            if (end == i) {
                jump++;
                end = reachable;
                if (end >= nums.length - 1) break;
            }
        }
        return jump;
    }
}
```

### **Edge Cases:**

- If the array contains only one element (`nums.length == 1`), no jumps are needed, so the result is `0`.
- The array contains large values allowing a quick jump to the end.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only a few variables are used to track the jumps and the range.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Let's walk through **Example 1** with `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`:

- **Initial State:**
  - `reachable = 0`
  - `end = 0`
  - `jump = 0`

1. **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
   - `nums[0] = 2`
   - Update `reachable`: `reachable = Math.max(0, 0 + 2) = 2`
   - Since `i == end` (`0 == 0`), increment `jump`: `jump = 1`
   - Update `end` to `reachable`: `end = 2`

2. **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
   - `nums[1] = 3`
   - Update `reachable`: `reachable = Math.max(2, 1 + 3) = 4`
   - `i != end` (`1 != 2`), so no jump increment yet.

3. **Iteration 3 (i = 2):**
   - `nums[2] = 1`
   - Update `reachable`: `reachable = Math.max(4, 2 + 1) = 4`
   - Since `i == end` (`2 == 2`), increment `jump`: `jump = 2`
   - Update `end` to `reachable`: `end = 4`
   - Since `end >= nums.length - 1` (`4 >= 4`), the loop breaks.

The total number of jumps is `2`.

---

### **Mistakes and Learning:**

- It can be tempting to think that you need to explore every possible path, but the greedy approach minimizes the number of jumps effectively by always choosing the farthest reachable index within the current range.
- Tracking the `end` correctly and updating the number of jumps only when reaching it is critical for ensuring the minimum number of jumps.

---

### **Alternate Solutions:**

- **Dynamic Programming:** In a less efficient approach, we could use DP to track the minimum number of jumps to reach each index, but this would have a higher time complexity of `O(n^2)`.
