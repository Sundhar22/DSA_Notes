### [**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/hand-of-straights/)

You are given an array `hand` of integers representing cards, and an integer `groupSize`. The goal is to determine if it's possible to rearrange the cards into one or more groups of `groupSize` cards, where each group contains consecutive integers.

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]`, `groupSize = 3`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** Possible groups: `[1,2,3]`, `[2,3,4]`, `[6,7,8]`.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `groupSize = 4`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** It's impossible to form groups of 4 consecutive cards.

### **Approach:**

- **Step 1:** First, check if the total number of cards is divisible by `groupSize`. If not, it's impossible to rearrange the cards into the required groups.
- **Step 2:** Use a `TreeMap` to count the frequency of each card and keep them sorted.
- **Step 3:** Iterate through the cards, trying to form groups of consecutive integers starting from the smallest card. For each group, decrease the count of each card used.
- **Step 4:** If at any point you can't form a valid group, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true` after all groups are formed.

### **Solution (Java):**

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean isNStraightHand(int[] hand, int groupSize) {
        if (hand.length % groupSize != 0) {
            return false; // If the total number of cards is not divisible by groupSize, it's impossible to rearrange
        }

        // Use a TreeMap to count the frequency of each card and keep it sorted
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> cardCount = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int card : hand) {
            cardCount.put(card, cardCount.getOrDefault(card, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Try to form groups starting from the smallest available card
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : cardCount.entrySet()) {
            int card = entry.getKey();
            int count = entry.getValue();
            
            // If there are any cards of this value left
            if (count > 0) {
                // Try to form a group of consecutive cards starting from 'card'
                for (int i = 0; i < groupSize; i++) {
                    int currentCard = card + i;
                    // Check if we have enough of the next card in sequence
                    if (cardCount.getOrDefault(currentCard, 0) < count) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    // Reduce the count for the current card
                    cardCount.put(currentCard, cardCount.get(currentCard) - count);
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### **Edge Cases:**
- If the length of `hand` is not divisible by `groupSize`, return `false` immediately since it's impossible to create equal-sized groups.
- If there are cards that can't be grouped into consecutive sets, return `false`.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of cards. Sorting the cards using `TreeMap` takes `O(log n)`, and for each card, you process the group in `O(groupSize)` time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` because we use a `TreeMap` to store the count of each card.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Let's walk through **Example 1** with `hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8]` and `groupSize = 3`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cardCount = {1=1, 2=2, 3=2, 4=1, 6=1, 7=1, 8=1}`
   - Total cards = `9`, divisible by `groupSize = 3`.

2. **Forming the first group:**
   - Start with the smallest card, `1`.
   - Form the group `[1,2,3]` (reduce counts by `1`):
     - `cardCount = {1=0, 2=1, 3=1, 4=1, 6=1, 7=1, 8=1}`.

3. **Forming the second group:**
   - The next smallest available card is `2`.
   - Form the group `[2,3,4]` (reduce counts by `1`):
     - `cardCount = {1=0, 2=0, 3=0, 4=0, 6=1, 7=1, 8=1}`.

4. **Forming the third group:**
   - The next smallest available card is `6`.
   - Form the group `[6,7,8]` (reduce counts by `1`):
     - `cardCount = {1=0, 2=0, 3=0, 4=0, 6=0, 7=0, 8=0}`.

At the end of the loop, all cards have been grouped into consecutive sets. Therefore, the output is `true`.

### **Mistakes and Learning:**
- When using a `TreeMap`, remember that it keeps the cards sorted, which is essential for forming consecutive groups efficiently.
- Ensure that you handle cases where there aren't enough cards to form a full group. In such cases, return `false` immediately.

---

### **Alternate Solutions:**
- **Sorting and Greedy:** Sort the `hand` array, then use a greedy approach to form groups of consecutive cards. This approach would also take `O(n log n)` time, but using a `TreeMap` is more convenient for frequency counting and handling consecutive numbers.
