### [**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i`-th station is given by `gas[i]`. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i`-th station to its next station `(i + 1) % n`. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return `-1`. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `gas = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `cost = [3,4,5,1,2]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:**  
- Start at station 3, with `4` units of gas.  
- Travel to station 4. Now you have `4 - 1 + 5 = 8` units of gas.  
- Travel to station 0. Now you have `8 - 2 + 1 = 7` units of gas.  
- Travel to station 1. Now you have `7 - 3 + 2 = 6` units of gas.  
- Travel to station 2. Now you have `6 - 4 + 3 = 5` units of gas.  
- Travel to station 3. Now you have `5 - 5 + 4 = 4` units of gas.  
- You've completed the circuit with `4` units of gas remaining.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `gas = [2,3,4]`, `cost = [3,4,3]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:** You can't start at any station to complete the circuit.

### **Approach:**

- First, calculate the total gas and total cost required to complete the circuit.
- Track the starting index (`startIndex`) of the potential starting station.
- Track the current fuel as you traverse each station:
  - If at any point, the current fuel drops below zero, it means you cannot start the journey from the current starting station. Reset the starting station to the next station and reset the fuel to `0`.
- If the total gas is less than the total cost, it's impossible to complete the circuit, so return `-1`.

---

### **Solution (Java):**

```java
class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalGas = 0, totalCost = 0;
        int startIndex = 0, currentFuel = 0;

        // Loop through each gas station
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            totalGas += gas[i];
            totalCost += cost[i];
            currentFuel += gas[i] - cost[i];

            // If at any point current fuel is less than 0, reset the start index
            if (currentFuel < 0) {
                startIndex = i + 1;
                currentFuel = 0;
            }
        }

        // If total gas is less than total cost, it's not possible to complete the circuit
        if (totalGas < totalCost) {
            return -1;
        }

        return startIndex;
    }
}
```

### **Solution (Python):**

```python
def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
    totGas, totCost = 0, 0
    curInx = 0
    calFuel = 0

    for i in range(len(gas)):
        totGas += gas[i]
        totCost += cost[i]
        calFuel += gas[i] - cost[i]

        if calFuel < 0:
            curInx = i + 1
            calFuel = 0

    if totGas < totCost:
        return -1

    return curInx
```

---

### **Edge Cases:**
- If the total gas available is less than the total cost, return `-1` since it is impossible to complete the circuit.
- If `gas.length == 1`, check if `gas[0] >= cost[0]`. If yes, return `0`; otherwise, return `-1`.

---

### **Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of gas stations. We loop through the `gas` and `cost` arrays once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since only a few variables are used to keep track of the total gas, total cost, current fuel, and starting index.

---

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Let's walk through **Example 1** with `gas = [1,2,3,4,5]` and `cost = [3,4,5,1,2]`:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `totalGas = 0`
   - `totalCost = 0`
   - `startIndex = 0`
   - `currentFuel = 0`

2. **Iteration 1 (i = 0):**
   - `totalGas = 1`, `totalCost = 3`
   - `currentFuel = gas[0] - cost[0] = 1 - 3 = -2`
   - Since `currentFuel < 0`, update `startIndex = 1` and reset `currentFuel = 0`.

3. **Iteration 2 (i = 1):**
   - `totalGas = 3`, `totalCost = 7`
   - `currentFuel = gas[1] - cost[1] = 2 - 4 = -2`
   - Again, `currentFuel < 0`, update `startIndex = 2` and reset `currentFuel = 0`.

4. **Iteration 3 (i = 2):**
   - `totalGas = 6`, `totalCost = 12`
   - `currentFuel = gas[2] - cost[2] = 3 - 5 = -2`
   - Update `startIndex = 3` and reset `currentFuel = 0`.

5. **Iteration 4 (i = 3):**
   - `totalGas = 10`, `totalCost = 13`
   - `currentFuel = gas[3] - cost[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - `currentFuel >= 0`, so keep `startIndex = 3`.

6. **Iteration 5 (i = 4):**
   - `totalGas = 15`, `totalCost = 15`
   - `currentFuel = gas[4] - cost[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `currentFuel >= 0`, so no change to `startIndex`.

At the end of the loop, `totalGas = totalCost`, meaning it's possible to complete the circuit. The starting index is `3`.

---

### **Mistakes and Learning:**
- Resetting the `startIndex` every time `currentFuel` becomes negative ensures that you always find the correct starting point.
- If `totalGas < totalCost`, you don't need to perform further calculations, as completing the circuit would be impossible.

---

### **Alternate Solutions:**
- **Brute Force:** Try starting from each station and simulate the circuit. This approach would have a time complexity of `O(n^2)` and is not efficient for large inputs.
