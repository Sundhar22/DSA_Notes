### [**Problem Description:**](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/)

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

#### Example 1:
**Input:** `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]`  
**Output:** `true`  
**Explanation:** Jump 1 step from index `0` to `1`, then 3 steps to the last index.

#### Example 2:
**Input:** `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** You will always arrive at index `3` no matter what. Its maximum jump length is `0`, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.

### **Approach:**

- Use a greedy algorithm to keep track of the farthest reachable index (`reachable`).
- Iterate over the array, updating `reachable` at each step based on the maximum possible distance that can be jumped from the current index.
- If at any point the current index is greater than `reachable`, return `false` as it's impossible to move further.
- If `reachable` becomes greater than or equal to the last index, return `true`.

### **Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int reachable = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {

            if (reachable < i) return false;

            reachable = Math.max(reachable, i + nums[i]);

            if (reachable >= nums.length - 1) return true;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### **Edge Cases:**
- The array contains only one element, so you're already at the last index (`nums.length == 1`).
- The maximum jump length at each index is `0`, making it impossible to proceed if you're not at the last index.

### **Complexity Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as only a few variables are used to track the reachable index.

### **Mistakes and Learning:**
- A common mistake is trying to backtrack or overcomplicate the problem with dynamic programming. The greedy approach is sufficient to solve this problem optimally.
- It's important to realize that the problem can be reduced to checking whether the index is reachable at each step.

### **Alternate Solutions:**
- **Dynamic Programming:** We could use a DP table to track whether each index is reachable. However, this would have a higher space complexity of `O(n)` and a similar time complexity of `O(n)`.
